5. After coming out from frontend folder path, that is in home directory, now you can run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to run the app in the development mode which runs frontend as well as backend at the same time using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) npm package. It can be viewed in browser at `http:localhost:3000`. Backend will be running at the `PORT` number you specified in `.env` file.
6. For bundling, navigate to frontend folder path and try running `npm run build` or `yarn build` which optimises build for better performance
